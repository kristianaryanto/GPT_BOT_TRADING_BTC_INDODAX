## üìà Automated Bitcoin Trading Bot using GPT & Indodax

This project is an automated trading bot designed to trade Bitcoin (BTC) on the Indodax exchange using decisions made by GPT (GPT-4o-mini). It automates the trading process from data retrieval, decision making, to executing buy/sell orders. 

By leveraging AI-based decisions, this bot aims to optimize your trading performance through automated processes and strategic insights.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Decisions**: Utilizes GPT to analyze market data and make trading decisions.
- **Automated Trading**: Executes buy/sell orders on the Indodax exchange based on GPT signals.
- **Future-Proof**: Currently includes take-profit strategy, with future plans to add stop loss and margin trading.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository contains 3 core components:

1. **`full_bod.py`**  
   This script is the main entry point that orchestrates the entire process:
   - Cancels open orders
   - Retrieves trading decisions from GPT
   - Executes orders (buy/sell)

2. **`gpt_runner.py`**  
   Fetches market data from Indodax using a 1-hour timeframe over the last 24 hours. The data is processed, and GPT provides trading signals based on this analysis.

3. **`order_operator.py`**  
   This script is responsible for executing buy/sell orders based on GPT's signals. Currently, it implements a take-profit strategy, with future enhancements planned, such as stop-loss and margin trading.
